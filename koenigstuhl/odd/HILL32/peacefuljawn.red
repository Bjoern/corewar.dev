;author Zul Nadzri
;strategy - ====coded especially for CSE2005 Quarter Final====
;strategy - Again (and again) victory mostly depends on good anticipation of opponent's strategy.
;strategy - Usually, it is better not to anticipate anything and put the passion into a warrior.
;strategy - This time, I am going to resurrect another off-hill warrior.
;strategy - May be can submit to the hill after this, after all the effort spent for this round.
;strategy - I picked Dawn 2, Roy's warrior because the core is definitely less than 50 lines.
;strategy - Why Dawn? I admit it has disadvantages. So do other warriors. Remember the stone/scissor/paper analogy?
;strategy - Why paper? I am sure G.Labarga loves to destroy papers with his scanner...
;strategy - ...and I am going to give him a challenge that he is looking for! You better win dude!!
;strategy - More tips: this warrior can't beat Recon2
;strategy - First, I removed Dawn's Qscan to meet the 50 lines standard.
;strategy - Second, I removed all empty codes, making the warrior compact to attract scanners to the 'decoy'.
;strategy - Third, I filled gaps with stp.ab >0, #0 just in case it can be executed. Put PIN 13 on top.
;strategy - Fourth, Gave a good name "Peaceful Jawn". Ain't is beautiful?
;strategy - Fifth, Jawn = John + Dawn. Acousticly, 'Jawn' is 'John'...almost the same sound and frequency.
;strategy - Sixth, send early to Fizmo and enjoy my holiday.
;strategy - Seventh, if your name is John, this is not related to you ;)
